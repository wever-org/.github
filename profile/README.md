**A fully customizable, flexible, declarative,
component-based JavaScript framework & library to build
complex and incredible UI (User Interface).**

It makes developing web-applications **easy, fast &
painless**. It allows you to create component view in
your application and easily manage them.
Writing both HTML & Javascript together without
template litrals makes the **application declarative,
easier to manage and faster**.

* ***Javascript XML:***
Write both HTML and Javascript together in a single
Javascript file. Rather than using template literals,
here you are allowed to use Javascript XML expression (JSX).

* ***Component Based:***
Create your own XEON Component to create and manage
complicated User Interfaces. Those components are
reusable and can be used in multiple places.

* ***In-built Router:***
XEON JS comes with a built-in router that helps you to
navigate between different pages. It's a very simple but
powerfull router, including url parameters to make your
application more dynamic.
